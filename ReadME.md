Jawwy TV 
	
Diversifying Kingdomâ€™s economy is vital for its sustainability. Even though oil and gas are 
essential pillars of the economy, the Kingdom has expanded its investments into new sectors. Moreover, 
one of those sectors is entertainment. The cinema industry is one of the most critical parts of the 
entertainment sector, but in Saudi Arabia, it is tiny because it considers a new industry. In this project, 
we will try to understand the audience in Saudi Arabia to help grow this field until the Saudi cinema 
industry reaches internationality stardom.

Analyzing the dataset related to movies and tv shows is part 
of this project. This dataset provides by Jawwy TV, which is a Saudi application. After analyzing this 
dataset, we have found many outcomes from Jawwy TV.

The first analysis was for a bar chart for average rating and genre, we tried to find the most 
popular types of movies and TV shows that Saudi subscribers like to watch on Jawwy TV. It is clear from 
the graph that Saudis like to watch drama and Horror movies. On the other hand, we can see clearly that 
Jawwy TV audiences do not like to watch documentaries and adventure programs.

The bar chart shows that number of votes during months is almost the same except for August 
and June. The votes were higher than others, reaching up to 450 votes in June and August.Also, on the bar chart of the distribution of program genre based on the duration of seconds, we noticed that the last three months of the year have the highest numbers of views. November views go above 10 million seconds. Furthermore, it decreases in the first two months of the year where the duration of seconds went below 3 million.

According to the pie chart of the HD quality, 37% of the movies and programs do not have an HD 
option. At the same time, just 63% have an HD option. Also, it is clear from the number of viewers that 
Saudis like to watch series more than movies. The difference is 71.773 viewers, which is a slightly large 
number. Animation movies have the highest number of movies with HD quality with almost 150 
thousand protections and the highest who have not HD moves based on their large number of 
production where it went over 250 thousand.

Moreover, we found out the top five types of movie subscribers like on Jawwy TV, which were 
drama, horror, comedy, action and the last one of the top five is a thriller. The ratings of those types of 
movies are from 20.000 to 30.000 ratings. For example, all drama movies rating is equal to 30K. 
However, the adventure movies rate equals 10K. The line chart shows that views increase above 150 
thousand seconds by month between February and Jun. Moreover, decrease below 100 thousand 
seconds between July and January.

After analyzing the data and getting some outcomes from the analysis. We have looked and 
searched for an appropriate way to build a recommendation system. There are three types of the 
recommendation system collaborative filtering, content-Based Filtering, and hybrid Recommendation 
systems. The most appropriate one in our case is the collaborative filtering because we do not have a 
description of the movies and identify preferences and information from many users.

We have started building a clustering model first after choosing the type of the recommendation.
The first model is a clustering model for clustering users and movies, which is useful to build a 
recommendation system. In this model, we have clustered the data into 8 clusters based on movie id, 
user id, and the average rating. Then we have built a recommendation system to get different movies id, 
and titles suggested for the users.

The second model is the apriori which can work for frequent item set mining and association 
rule learning over relational databases. Here we have use it to help in generating movies
recommendations based on user id and views in the dataset. 

Conclusion and future work:
The results of the recommendation system of apriori model were more sufficient than in the clustering 
model. It can suggest movies to various users based on the Jawwy TV data that they have collected for 
that user. A future plan to improve this project is using the matrix factorization which can improve our 
machine learning.
